The program Boussinesq simulates the dynamics of water-\/table surface solved in a hillslope or a small catchment. The theory is based on the 2\-D Boussinesq Equation\-: \[ s\frac {\partial \eta} {\partial t} = \nabla \cdot \left[ K_S \, H (\eta,x,y) \, \nabla \eta \right]+Q \] where $ \eta $ is the piezometric elevation (unknown), $ t $ is time, $ \nabla $ is the space gradient operator, $ H(\eta,x,y) $ is the thickness of the aquifer which is a function of $ \eta $ and space, $Q $ is a source term which also accounts for boundary conditions, $K_S $ is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and $s $ is porosity . \begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
The Boussinesq Equation is solved with finite volume numerical methods according to Casulli, 2008 ( \href{http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121377724/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0}{\tt http\-://www3.\-interscience.\-wiley.\-com/journal/121377724/abstract?\-C\-R\-E\-T\-R\-Y=1\&\-S\-R\-E\-T\-R\-Y=0} and \href{http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wrcr.20072/references}{\tt http\-://onlinelibrary.\-wiley.\-com/doi/10.\-1002/wrcr.\-20072/references}) The Maps of distributed quantiaties are distributed as vectors of double float numbers (D\-O\-B\-L\-E\-V\-E\-C\-T\-O\-R data struct type ,in this case)
