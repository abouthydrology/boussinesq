{"name":"Boussinesq","tagline":"A mass-conservative method for the integration of the two-dimensional groundwater (Boussinesq) equation  ","body":"The Boussinesq Model\r\n\r\nThis code implements a new conservative finite-volume numerical solution for the two-dimensional groundwater flow (Boussinesq) equation, which can be used for investigations of hillslope subsurface flow processes and simulations of catchment hydrology. The Boussinesq equation, which is integrated for each grid element, can take account of the local variations of topography and soil properties within the individual elements. The numerical method allows for wetting and drying of the water table, without “ad hoc assumptions.” The stability and convergence of the method is shown to be guaranteed a priori by the properties of the solver itself, even with respect to the boundary conditions, an aspect that has been neglected in previous literature. The numeric solutions were validated against some approximate analytical solutions and compared to those of another (1-D) numerical solver of the Boussinesq equation. Further theoretical details are now available on http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wrcr.20072/abstract . Doxygen documentation of the code is available on the subdirectory \"doc\" and on https://github.com/ecor/boussinesq/blob/master/doc/html/index.html\r\n\r\n\r\n...
