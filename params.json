The Boussinesq equation, which is integrated for each grid element, can take account of the local variations of topography and soil properties within the individual elements. The numerical method allows for wetting and drying of the water table, without “ad hoc assumptions.” The stability and convergence of the method is shown to be guaranteed a priori by the properties of the solver itself, even with respect to the boundary conditions, an aspect that has been neglected in previous literature. The numeric solutions were validated against some approximate analytical solutions and compared to those of another (1-D) numerical solver of the Boussinesq equation. Further theoretical details are now available on http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wrcr.20072/abstract .\r\n\r\nBrief Historical Introduction \r\n\r\nThe earliest drafts of code were borm from an idea of Dr. Emanuele Cordano, Prof. Riccardo Rigon and Prof. Vincenzo Casulli about numerical methods for solving groundwater equation  preserving the mass conservation principle and taking into account the possible variability of bedrock topograhy and soil properties within the integration cell. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<iframe \r\nsrc=\"http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/22607590\" width=\"342\" height=\"291\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px\" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen> </iframe> \r\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\"> \r\n<strong> \r\n<a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/EmanueleCordano/boussinesq-real-bookv3\" title=\"Double-grid 2D solver for Boussinesq Equation (BEq) ...
