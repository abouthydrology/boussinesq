{"name":"Boussinesq","tagline":"A mass-conservative method for the integration of the two-dimensional groundwater (Boussinesq) equation  ","body":"The Boussinesq Model\r\n\r\nThis code implements a new conservative finite-volume numerical solution for the two-dimensional groundwater flow (Boussinesq) equation, which can be used for investigations of hillslope subsurface flow processes and simulations of catchment hydrology. The Boussinesq equation, which is integrated for each grid element, can take account of the local variations of topography and soil properties within the individual elements. The numerical method allows for wetting and drying of the water table, without ‚Äúad hoc assumptions.‚Äù The stability and convergence of the method is shown to be guaranteed a priori by the properties of the solver itself, even with respect to the boundary conditions, an aspect that has been neglected in previous literature. The numeric solutions were validated against some approximate analytical solutions and compared to those of another (1-D) numerical solver of the Boussinesq equation. Further theoretical details are now available on http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wrcr.20072/abstract or can be asked the authors (emanuele.cordano@gmail.com) without any hesitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nBrief Historical Introduction \r\n\r\nThe earliest drafts of code were borm from an idea of Dr. Emanuele Cordano, Prof. Riccardo Rigon and Prof. Vincenzo Casulli (University of Trento) about numerical methods for solving groundwater equation  preserving the mass conservation principle and taking into account the possible variability of bedrock topograhy and soil properties within the integration cell. \r\nSome of the first 2009/2010 informal presentations introduce the physical problem and are available here. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<iframe \r\nsrc=\"http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/22607590\" width=\"342\" height=\"291\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px\" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen> </iframe> \r\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\"> \r\n<strong> \r\n<a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/EmanueleCordano/boussinesq-real-bookv3\" title=\"Double-grid 2D solver for Boussinesq Equation (BEq) ...

A Doxygen-generated documentation of the code is available on the subdirectory \"doc\" and on https://github.com/ecor/boussinesq/blob/master/doc/html/index.html . The source code is mostly written in C using [FluidTurtle](http://www.ing.unitn.it/~rigon/fluidturtles_new/html/menu.htm) formalism (Rigon et al., 1990s). \r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nInstructions for Usage (Under Construction) \r\n\r\nTher code can be obtained by [git] (http://git-scm.com/) as follows: \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/ecor/boussinesq.git\r\n\r\n```\r\nFurther details are available on [git] (http://git-scm.com/) and [git-Wikipedia] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software), another useful tutorial on git is [here](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html) \r\nThis section is UNDER CONSTRUSCTION and will be performed as soon! \r\nThe source and documentation are contained in the following directory and its subdirectories:\r\n```\r\n$ cd boussinesq\r\n```\r\nHere is contained a very simple makefile which allows you to build the source code very quickly, by launching: \r\n``` \r\n$ make all\r\n```\r\nThe executable file is contained in the \"bin\" subdirectory and it is named \"boussinesq\". \r\nIt can be launched as follows: \r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/boussinesq <arguments>\r\n``` \r\nThe target: \r\n``` \r\n$ make clean\r\n```\r\nwill possibly uninstall boussinesq and remove the executable files.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
